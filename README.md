“Baby on board” is an online subscription based platform that mainly aims at selecting the right products for the baby which are 
specifically designed for different age groups.
All the required products can be purchased online with the best suitable package. It also allows parents to customize the subscription 
packages and plans, to best accommodate their needs.
This project was developed in an agile manner and GOF and GRASP principles was applied.
